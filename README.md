FORTRAN code for simulating the diffusion and deformation process induced by pump tests in a layered poroelastic half-space.

Highlights:

(1) orthonormal propagator algorithm for numerical stability

(2) fully coupled diffusion and deformation system based on Biot’s poroelasticity theory

(3) wave-number-domain differential filter technique for fast convergence of numerical Hankel transform
